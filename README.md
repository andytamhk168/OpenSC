# Open-source Spectral Calculation (OpenSC)

OpenSC is a web-based radiation code that can be used to evaluate total emissivity and total absorptivity of a typical combustion mixture consisted of H2O, CO2, N2, O2, and/or soot particulates. 

The web-based calculation tool utilizes the mathematical formulation of a neural network-based correlation (RAD-NNET) and it accounts for the realistic emission/absorption effect of non-gray gases and soot particulates.

The web version of OpenSC located at http://radnnet-wyuen.appspot.com is always up-to-date with the OpenSC provided in this repository.
